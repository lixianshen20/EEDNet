# EEDNet
## Notes

The code of this repository is still under organization, and the current structure may look incomplete.  
Benefiting from the excellent performance of **EDTER** in edge detection, the feature extraction part of our method is directly based on its official implementation: [EDTER GitHub](https://github.com/MengyangPu/EDTER).  
You may refer to the provided model architecture diagram to adapt the EDTER code for reproducing EEDNet.
